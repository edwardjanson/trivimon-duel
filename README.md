## Gameplay

- Win a duel against the computer. The player and computer start with a randomly selected ‘Trivimon’ with different health points (HP) and moves.
- The starting Trivimon is decided on the pace characteristic. 
- At the start of each round, the player answers a random multiple choice trivia question. On the player’s round, an ability damage multiplier is set to x3 if answered correctly or x0.5 if answered incorrectly, and vice versa on the computer’s round.
- Once a Trivimon loses all HP, the winner is decided.
